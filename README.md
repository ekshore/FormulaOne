# Formula One Data Collection

This Project is experimenting with large datasets. Because I enjoy motor sport and there is a lot of statistics kept around Formula 1 it makes for a good dataset to work with. Hopefully a front end will be coming in the near future to visualize all of these statistics.

## Current state
This project currently scrapes data from the F1 website and dumps it in my own DynamoDB table for future use.
